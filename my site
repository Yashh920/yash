<h3>NCERT Solutions for Class 9 Maths Chapter 10 Circles Ex 10.1 are part of NCERT Solutions for Class 9 Maths. Here we have given NCERT Solutions for Class 9 Maths Chapter 10 Circles Ex 10.1.</h3>
        
<p>Ex 10.1 Class 9 Maths Question 1.<br>
    Fill in the blanks.<br>
    (i) The centre of a circle lies in ___ of the circle. (exterior/interior)<br>
    (ii) A point, whose distance from the centre of a circle is greater than its radius lies in ____ of the circle, (exterior/interior)<br>
    (iii) The longest chord of a circle is a ____ of the circle.<br>
    (iv) An arc is a ____ when its ends are the ends of a diameter.<br>
    (v) Segment of a circle is the region between an arc and ____ of the circle.<br>
    (vi) A circle divides the plane, on which it lies, in ____ parts.<br>
    Solution:<br>
    (i) interior<br>
    (ii) exterior<br>
    (iii) diameter<br>
    (iv) semicircle<br>
    (v) the chord<br>
    (vi) three</p>
    <p>Ex 10.1 Class 9 Maths&nbsp;Question 2.<br>
        Write True or False. Give reason for your answers.<br>
        (i) Line segment joining the centre to any point on the circle is a , radius of the circle.<br>
        (ii) A circle has only finite number of equal chords.<br>
        (iii) If a circle is divided into three equal arcs, each is a major arc.<br>
        (iv) A chord of a circle, which is twice as long as its radius, is a diameter of the circle.<br>
        (v) Sector is the region between the chord and its corresponding arc.<br>
        (vi) A circle is a plane figure.<br>
        Solution:<br>
        (i) True [∵ All points on the circle are equidistant from the centre]<br>
        (ii) False [ ∵ A circle can have an infinite number of equal chords]<br>
        (iii) False [∵ Each part will be less than a semicircle]<br>
        (iv) True [ ∵ Diameter = 2 x Radius]<br>
        (v) False [ ∵ The region between the chord and its corresponding arc is a segment]<br>
        (vi) True [ ∵ A circle is drawn on a plane]</p>


        <h3>NCERT Solutions for Class 9 Maths Chapter 10 Circles Ex 10.2</h3>
<p>Ex 10.2 Class 9 Maths Question 1.<br>
Recall that two circles are congruent, if they have the same radii. Prove that equal chords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres<br>
Solution:<br>
Given: Two congruent circles with centres O and O’ and radii r, which have chords AB and CD respectively such that AB = CD.<br>
To Prove: ∠AOB = ∠CO’D<br>
Proof: In ∆AOB and ∆CO’D, we have<br>
AB = CD [Given]<br>
OA = O’C [Each equal to r]<br>
OB = O’D [Each equal to r]<br>
∴ ∆AOB ≅ ∆CO’D [By SSS congruence criteria]<br>
⇒ ∠AOB = ∠CO’D [C.P.C.T.]<br>

<p>Ex 10.2 Class 9 Maths&nbsp;Question 2.<br>
    Prove that, if chords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres, then the chords are equal.<br>
    Solution:<br>
    Given: Two congruent circles with centres O &amp; O’ and radii r which have chords AB and CD respectively such that ∠AOB = ∠CO’D.<br>

    To Prove: AB = CD<br>
    Proof: In ∆AOB and ∆CO’D, we have<br>
    OA = O’C [Each equal to r]<br>
    OB = O’D [Each equal to r]<br>
    ∠AOB = ∠CO’D [Given]<br>
    ∴ ∆AOB ≅ ∆CO’D [By SAS congruence criteria]<br>
    Hence, AB = CD [C.P.C.T.]</p>
